# üìä Algorithms and Data Structure Project ‚Äì Python Optimization & Complexity Analysis

This project was developed as part of my coursework at Northumbria University. It focuses on reviewing and enhancing a pre-existing Python program by applying algorithmic principles and data structure improvements to optimize performance across multiple use cases.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The goal was to identify performance bottlenecks, refactor inefficient code, and validate improvements through runtime analysis and visualization. This involved:

- Replacing suboptimal data structures (e.g. lists ‚Üí sets/dictionaries)
- Evaluating algorithmic complexity using Big-O notation
- Refactoring access patterns for mid-list operations
- Measuring execution time with `time.perf_counter()`
- Visualizing sorting performance across datasets (1K‚Äì100K entries)

---

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Big-O Analysis**: Annotated each function with its theoretical time complexity.
- **Data Structure Selection**: Chose optimal structures for lookup, insertion, and iteration.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Used `time.perf_counter()` for precise timing.
- **Visualization**: Plotted runtime trends using `matplotlib` to compare algorithm efficiency.
